        <p><strong>Players:</strong> One player (solitaire) playing as attack nuclear submarine (SSN).</p>
        <p><strong>Rules:</strong> The rules for this game are compact and every word chosen carefully.  Abbreviations are defined once, when first used. Read all the rules before attempting. Veteran gamers may find reading compact rules easier.  A how-to-play YouTube video may teach better: TBD.</p>
        <p><strong>Supplies:</strong> Large table, measuring tape, six-sided dice (d6). Cut out all (double-sided) pieces; if needed, fold and glue sheet first.</p>
        <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Place frigates (FF) 4 inches (4") away from each other in a square and the landing helicopter dock (LHD) in the center of the square pointing in the same direction and equidistant from all FFs. All ships should be Unalerted (light blue side). Place the SSN outside 30" from the nearest FF at deep depth and place any slow detection point (DP) beside it. (Ships and the SSN have a front with a triangle.) Place 2 helicopters (helos) aboard the LHD and 1 on each FF.</p>
        <p><strong>Sequence of Play:</strong> SSN takes all actions, then surface assets (surf; includes ships and helos) take all actions. 1st: Roll detections (surf only); 2nd: Attack; 3rd: Maneuver.</p>
        <p><strong>Detection Step:</strong> If surf taking actions: 1st, if any ship started this step Alerted (red side), flip all ships to Alerted. 2nd: roll 2d6 for all DPs.  Each ship/helo checks if the result was a successful detection. Unalerted units use passive sonar; Alerted units use active sonar. If Unalerted ship got a successful detection, they are flipped to their Alerted side.  If Alerted ship/helo successfully detected and is within 12" of the sub or DP detected, it fires torpedos (torps) targeting the SSN. Helos are always Alert and listen at marker's depth.</p>
        <p><strong>Detection Rolls:</strong> A detection roll against a target (ship or DP) succeeds if the roll of 2d6 (add pips) equals the detection threshold or higher. See detection table for modifiers, which subtract from the threshold needed to succeed. Listeners at shallow depth can only detect targets in a convergence zone (CZ). CZs are measured from the listener. They are 4" wide bands, starting 4" away from the listener or another CZ. A ship or SSN is in a convergence zone if any part of the marker is. Ships always listen at shallow depth.</p>
        <p><strong>Attack Step:</strong> An attack spawns a torp at shooter's depth (always shallow for surf). Target must be within 18" to hit and shooter's speed ≤Fast (except Helo). 1st: Torp rolls 2d6 to detect the target with active sonar.  2nd: Move torp 5" in straight line to target or until it reaches target.  After the first full 5" move, torp is at target depth if not already.  3rd: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until torp reaches target. If the torp never successfully detected or failed 2 detections in a row, it missed. If torp at target depth and reaches target in a move, the torp hits. If target is SSN: roll 1d6 for evasion save (≥6), -1 from threshold per torp detection roll. If evasion fails, SSN is destroyed. If target is a ship: roll 1d6 to kill (≥2). 1 kill destroys FF, 2 kills destroy LHD. Mark kills with a Kill marker (flipped torp). SSN has 4 torps and can fire 2 a turn.  Ships fire 1 torp a turn. Helos fire two torps, then are removed from play. Fired torps Alert all ships immediately.</p>
        <p><strong>Destroyed Ships:</strong> Destroyed ships become wrecks. Wrecks do nothing. Helos aboard are lost. Other ships avoid wrecks in maneuver, making the legal move closest to what they would do if the wreck was not present.</p>
        <p><strong>SSN Maneuver Step:</strong> 1st: Remove all DPs other than the one at SSN. For DP at SSN, mark SSN's current depth. 2nd: Change SSN depth (flip SSN marker) to Deep if Dive marker or to Shallow if Rise marker, then remove marker.  3rd: Move sub (leaving DP behind). Sub's travel distance depends on speed level: 0-2" for Creep; >2-4" for Slow; >4-6" for Fast; >6-8" for Flank. SSN can go up or down 1 speed level from current speed. SSN can turn Sharp every 1" if speed ≤Slow, otherwise Easy for every 2". Marks on turn tool are 1" long. No obligation to make the full turn with the tool, but must move full 1" to complete the turn, then move 1" for ≤Slow or 2" at ≥Fast before making anothere turn. SSN may place a Dive/Rise marker if it fired no torps. Place any DP at new SSN location with correct speed (the sub shows the DP's depth). Place any 3rd DP directy in front of SSN at distance traveled with same speed as the SSN but at future depth.</p>
        <p><strong>Ship Maneuver Step:</strong> Follow rules below. Ships that started the SSN action step Alerted launch all their helos (who move after ships move). Ships move simultaneously (no collisions; if unavoidable, stop right before).</p>
        <p><strong>LHD Maneuver:</strong> Roll 1d6: On 2-5, move forward 4"; Otherwise, move forward 3", Easy turn (left if rolled 1, right if 6), move remaining 1". If 1 Kill marker on LHD, moves forward 1" only (no die roll).</p>
        <p><strong>FF Maneuver:</strong> If LHD is not destroyed, do same maneuver as LHD. Otherwise, randomly select DP with 1d6 (DP1: 1-2; DP2: 3-4; DP3: 5-6) and maneuver in its direction via shortest route, moving forward and making an Easy turn every 2" until having traveled 6" (like Fast SSN).</p>
        <p><strong>Helo Maneuver:</strong> Helo marker sides indicate helo's sonar depth. If helo is Deep or launched by ship this turn, randomly select DP with 1d6 (DP1: 1-2; DP2: 3-4; DP3: 5-6) and move in straight line to DP until 5" away. If helo is Shallow, flip to Deep; do not move.</p>
        <p><strong>Victory:</strong> As SSN, destroy the LHD, get beyond 12" from the nearest FF, and do not be detected for a turn. Destroy the LHD before any surf asset moves off the table.</p>
